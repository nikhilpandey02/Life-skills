# Good Practices for Software Development

### Question 1: Which point(s) were new to you?

- Writing down requirements during meetings and sharing them right away for feedback.
- Using tools like Trello or Jira to keep track of tasks and requirements.
- Always telling the team if something changes or if you face any issues (like internet problems or delays).
- Keeping video on during meetings to communicate better.
- Using screenshots, videos, or code-sharing sites to explain problems clearly.
- Being careful not to bother teammates with lots of messages; bundle your questions into one message.
- Tips about focusing better when working remotely like turning off distractions and managing time well.

### Question 2: Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

- I need to get better at telling my team about changes or problems quickly.
- To improve, I will:
  - Use group chats more often instead of private chats.
  - Always write clear explanations with pictures or code samples when stuck.
  - Keep my video on during calls even if I feel shy.
  - Use apps to help me focus and block distractions while working.
  - Plan my time better and take care of my health to stay productive.
